      Greetings! I'm Kinjal Momaya, a full stack web developer based in India. I embarked on an exciting career transition from corporate law to pursue my passion for web development. Alongside my expertise in web technologies, I am eager to expand my skill set to include Android and iOS development. When I'm not immersed in coding, you'll find me indulging in another creative pursuit: cooking delicious meals. With a focus on continuous learning and a knack for crafting exceptional digital experiences, I am dedicated to delivering innovative solutions that meet and exceed client expectations. Looking forward to collaborating with you and bringing your ideas to life!</p>
